How does FROSch construct the overlap from the fully assembled system matrix?

Example for a fluid problem with velocity and pressure fields:

K = ( A  B^T )
    ( B  0   )

"A" relates to the velocity field, and the rows of "B" to the pressure field. 
Since the bottom-right block is zero, it cannot be used to algebraically construct an overlap.

Consider the following mesh with numbered P1 finite element nodes (we can ignore the P2 finite element nodes for the description; they don't change anything).

   1__2__3__4
   |\ | /| /|
   | \|/ |/ |
   5__6__7__8

Each node in this 2D problem is associated with two velocity degrees of freedom and one pressure degree of freedom. 
We partition the mesh into two subdomains with uniquely distributed degrees of freedom: subdomain (1) contains the nodes (1,2,5,6), and subdomain (2) contains the nodes (3,4,7,8). The corresponding velocity and pressure degrees of freedom are I1 := (1,2,5,6, 9,10,13,14, 17,18,21,22) and I2 := (3,4,7,8, 11,12,15,16, 19,20,23,24) if they are sorted as (velocity x, velocity y, pressure). These are the sets we extend to obtain overlapping subdomains.

We focus on subdomain (1): For all indices i in I1, define a set O1 in which all indices j are such that K_{i,j} != 0. Then set I1 <-- I1 union O1. Now I1 describes the subdomain with overlap 1. This is repeated until the desired overlap size is reached.

In the mesh above, phi_2 (potentially (*)) interacts with the basis functions phi_j, j in {1,2,3,6, 9,10,11,14, 17,18,19,22}. Specifically, via phi_2, all degrees of freedom associated with node 3 are added to I1, including the pressure degree of freedom, which is included via a nonzero entry in B^T. Just looking at the pressure function phi_18 associated with node 2, the velocity degrees of freedom associated with node 3 would be added (via the matrix B) but not the corresponding pressure degree of freedom 19.

Conclusion: The pressure degrees of freedom are included in the overlap indirectly via the velocity degrees of freedom, since they interact (have nonzero entries) in B^T.

(*) We assume that a basis function phi_i is only nonzero on elements next to "i" (nodal basis function). Furthermore, there exist cases, even for diffusion problems, in which the bilinear form evaluated for phi_i and phi_j is zero, even though they are neighbors (i.e., their support has a positive measure).
